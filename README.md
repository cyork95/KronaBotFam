# What is KronaBotFam?
KronaBotFam is my family of python discord bots created for my personal servers. Feel free to use any or all of this code as 
you see fit.

## How does KronaBotFam work?
KronaBotFam used the discord.py library to make calls to discord and warframe's API
to retrieve information that can be used in the server.

##What bots are in KronaBotFam?
Currently there are four bots in the Krona bot family see each bot below for a description and link to the commands 
they can each perform.
